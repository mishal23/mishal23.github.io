I love developing software and like to explore Networks, Databases, Web Security. I strongly believe that technology can make the lives easier and thus keep exploring and learning. I graduated in Computer Science &#x26; Engineering from <a href=\"https://nitk.ac.in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">NITK, Surathkal</a>, India.</p>\n<p>I'm currently working as a Web Solutions Engineer at Google. Before joining Google, I worked for a little over a year at Cisco as a Software Engineer. I love to explore how the internet and the web works, and you'd mostly find me reading various engineering blogs. I also plan to read some books on <a href=\"/my-reading-list\">my reading list</a>.</p>\n<p>Participating in hackathons pump me up and every hackathon had something special to learn. The best ones were: <a href=\"https://sih.gov.in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smart India Hackathon 2018</a>, <a href=\"https://www.codefundo.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">code.fun.do</a>, <a href=\"https://hackinout.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">InOut 6.0</a> and the one that I lead organized: <a href=\"https://hackverse.nitk.ac.in/2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Level Hackathon - HackVerse</a>.</p>\n<p>During my time at university, I've contributed to open source by being a <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/4544832284917760/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Summer of Code Student in 2019</a>, serving as a mentor in <a href=\"https://codein.withgoogle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Code-in '19</a> and mentoring a project as a part of <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/4852224477364224/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">GSoC '20</a> with the <a href=\"https://nsnam.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ns-3 Organization</a> and a few other contributions.

I was part of various community groups at college, more about them <a href=\"/college-life/\">here</a></p>\n<p>When I'm not coding or exploring tech, I'm mostly sleeping or spending time with my parents. Other than that, I love playing basketball, eating different dishes and visiting different places.</p>\n<p>I started this site to share my personal experiences, learnings and technical knowledge. I'm aiming to expand with more quality content as I learn more.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","date":null,"description":"Mishal Shah is a full-stack developer with interests in Networks, Databases, Web Security.
