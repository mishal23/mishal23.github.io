Hi üëã, I'm Mishal Shah, a Software Engineer. I love developing software and like to explore Networks, Databases, Web Security. I strongly believe that technology can make the lives easier and thus keep exploring and learning. I graduated in Computer Science & Engineering from [NITK, Surathkal](https://nitk.ac.in), India.

I'm currently working as a Web Solutions Engineer at Google. Before joining Google, I worked for a little over a year at Cisco as a Software Engineer. I love to explore how the internet and the web works, and you'd mostly find me reading various engineering blogs. I also plan to read some books on [my reading list](/my-reading-list).

Participating in hackathons pump me up and every hackathon had something special to learn. The best ones were: [Smart India Hackathon 2018](https://sih.gov.in/), [code.fun.do](https://www.codefundo.io/), [InOut 6.0](https://hackinout.co/) and the one that I lead organized: [National Level Hackathon - HackVerse](https://hackverse.nitk.ac.in/2020).

During my time at university, I've contributed to open source by being a [Google Summer of Code Student in 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/4544832284917760/), serving as a mentor in [Google Code-in '19](https://codein.withgoogle.com/) and mentoring a project as a part of [GSoC '20](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/4852224477364224/) with the [ns-3 Organization](https://nsnam.org/) and a few other contributions. I have also interned at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) under [Prof. Venkatesh Chopella](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~venkatesh.choppella/) in the summer of 2018. I was part of various community groups at college, more about them [here](/college-life/)

When I'm not coding or exploring tech, I'm mostly sleeping or spending time with my parents. Other than that, I love playing basketball, eating different dishes and visiting different places.

I started this site to share my personal experiences, learnings and technical knowledge. I'm aiming to expand with more quality content as I learn more.
