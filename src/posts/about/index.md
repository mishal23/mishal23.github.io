Hi 👋, I'm Mishal Shah, a B.Tech graduate in Computer Science from [NITK, Surathkal](https://nitk.ac.in), India. I love software development and interested in Networks, Databases, Web Security. I strongly believe that technology can make the lives easier and thus keep exploring and learning.

I've recently [joined Cisco](/joining-cisco) as a Software Engineer. In the past, I've been [Google Summer of Code Student in 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/4544832284917760/), served as a mentor in [Google Code-in '19](https://codein.withgoogle.com/) and currently mentoring a project as a part of [GSoC '20](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6502257928962048) with the [ns-3 Organization](https://nsnam.org/). I have also interned at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) under [Prof. Venkatesh Chopella](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~venkatesh.choppella/) in 2018.

I have attend some hackathons ([Smart India Hackathon 2018](https://sih.gov.in/), [code.fun.do](https://www.codefundo.io/), [InOut 6.0](https://hackinout.co/)) and have lead organized a [National Level Hackathon - HackVerse](https://hackverse.nitk.ac.in/). I love helping the community, reading engineering articles or blogs of various companies/people and try to learn about the Web.

I'm a hard-working, enthusiastic, passionate developer. I also plan to read some books on [my reading list](/my-reading-list). At college, I was part of various community groups. More about my college life [here](/college-life/)

When I'm not coding or exploring tech, I'm mostly sleeping or spending time with my parents. Other than that, I love playing basketball, eating different dishes and visiting different places.

I started this site to share my personal experiences, learnings and technical knowledge. I'm aiming to expand with more quality content as I learn more.
