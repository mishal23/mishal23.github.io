At [university](https://nitk.ac.in/) I was part of various community groups:

- [IE NITK](https://ie.nitk.ac.in/): IE NITK is a technical club with interdisciplinary SIGs covering Computer Science, Electronics, Core Branches as well as Business, Script, Robotics, and Media SIGs. I served as a Convenor (Head) for the year 2019-20 for the same.
- [Web Enthusiasts' Club](https://webclub.nitk.ac.in/): WebClub is a Computer Science Club of NITK with various SIGs like Development, Algorithms, Intelligence, Systems. I served as the Development SIG Head for the year 2019-20 for the same.
- [IRIS NITK](https://iris.nitk.ac.in/): IRIS NITK is a student-led online Management Information System with over 25 different modules to digitize various pen-paper systems. I developed the NoDues Module and led the development team.

I also helped develop a Website for the 2019 edition of [TEDxNITKSurathkal](https://www.tedxnitksurathkal.in/), mentored two projects as part of [Winter of Code, NITK](https://woc-nitk.github.io), and helped students applying to open-source programs like GSoC by reviewing their proposals.
